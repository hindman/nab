Support ability to import user-define Steps.

Some end-to-end tests to exercise most behavior.

Better --help: show step docs and Step.DESC.

Support leading-dot syntax:
    m .skip 1 .head 12 .findall '\d+' .str .nl

Reassess existing steps and add more:
    cols
    wrap
    flip-flop
    filename
    linenumber
    tail
    dive
    cross

Check my scripts in $HOME/bin for behaviors not yet supported.

Support ability of user to control file-open mode.

step_has_phase(): confirm that this is robust (eg inheritance).

How does a user supply some other file-like object?

    [X, ...]

    Where X can be: ipath | (Yi, Yo, Ye)

    Where Y can be: path | (path, fh)


Overview:

    opts.fsets = list(FileSet)
    FileSet      = namedtuple with inp, out, err FileHandle
    FileHandle   = path, handle

Returned by discover phase:

    - Same as opts.fsets.
    - Or allowed short forms.

Short forms:

    FileSet:
        (inp, out, err) : fully explicit
        (inp, out)      : use standard streams for missing args
        (inp,)          : ditto
        inp             : ditto
        None            : ditto

    FileHandle:
        (path, None)    : regular file to be opened/closed
        path            : ditto
        None            : use standard stream
        (None, None)    : ditto
        (path, handle)  : fully explicit
        (None, handle)  : not allowed
        FileHandle      : same rules

Relationships among file handles in a file set:

    x   | stdin | stdout | stderr | f1  | f2  | f3
    ---------------------------------------------
    inp | Y     | .      | .      | Y1  | .   | .
    out | .     | Y      | .      | Y3* | Y2  | .
    err | .     | .      | Y      | Y6* | Y5* | Y4

    Where * means replace the input file.
