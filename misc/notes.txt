Support file discovery and file-specific output:
    - A Step can return a new list of paths to be used.
    - Can also return a list of tuples: (INPUT_PATH, OUTPUT_PATH, OUTPUT_ERR_PATH).
    - In that case, the output will go to separate files.
    - And if the paths are equal, the original file will be overwritten.

    x Collect results from discover-hook calls.
    - Convert to list of pairs for all cases.
    - Add util functions that Step code can use for printing/writing output to the correct handles.
    - Convert all print/write calls to those functions.
    - Adjust process_lines() to set things up so that those functions work correctly.

Some end-to-end tests.
    - Make sure all/most steps are working.

Steps: stop passing opts when calling phase methods?

Line: switch to immutable namedtuple.
    - Do work in branch so that both approaches can be benchmarked.
    - If namedtuple is slower, switch to property-based accessors in Line class.

Better --help: show step docs and Step.DESC.

Support leading-dot syntax:
    m .skip 1 .head 12 .findall '\d+' .str .nl

Reassess existing steps and add more:
    cols
    wrap
    flip-flop
    filename
    linenumber
    tail
    dive
    cross

Check my scripts in $HOME/bin for behaviors not yet supported.
