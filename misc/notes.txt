Support file discovery, file-specific output, and in-place editing:
    x Collect results from discover-hook calls.
    x Convert to list of pairs for all cases.
    - Adjust process_lines() to open output file handles as needed
    - Add util functions that Step code can use for printing/writing output to the correct handles.
    - Convert all print/write calls to those functions.

Some end-to-end tests.
    - Make sure all/most steps are working.

Information passing:
    - Attach ln and opts to Step instances, pass as args, or both?
    - Line as immutable namedtuple or global singleton?
    - If singleton, use property-based accessors?

Better --help: show step docs and Step.DESC.

Support leading-dot syntax:
    m .skip 1 .head 12 .findall '\d+' .str .nl

Reassess existing steps and add more:
    cols
    wrap
    flip-flop
    filename
    linenumber
    tail
    dive
    cross

Check my scripts in $HOME/bin for behaviors not yet supported.
