- Refactor to use a class-based approach.

    - Basic structure.

        class Step(object):
            ...

        class Range(Step):
            NAME = '...'
            DESC = '...'
            OPTS = [...]

            def begin(self, opts):
                ...

            def run(self, ln, opts):
                return ...

            def end(self, opts):
                ...

    - Benefits:

        - Some namespacing and code layout benefits: easier to define multiple
        steps in one file.

        - More extensible when adding new features.

        - Steps can inherit from each other.

        - Provides a scope for step-writers to persist information.

- Bug:

    - This should (wr)ite twice and (pr)int once. But wr occurs just 1 time.

    ll . | nab -a split '\s+' -a head 12 -a range 1 7 2 -a wr -a wr -a index 0 -a pr


- Decompose the entire process into phases, each having hook points:

    - Phases:

        - prepare:
            - Examples:
                - File discovery.
                - Even modify the list of steps (eg aln)

        - begin:
            - Each Step can configure itself.

        - Running loop:

            pre_file   # Before a path is opened.
            run        # Line processing.
            post_file  # After a file is closed.

        - end:
            - Print overall results.

- Add support for file-begin file-end.

- Add support for file-based output and in-place editing.
    - Currently, we can process multiple files as inputs.
    - But the output is a single stream.
    - We might want each input file to go to a separate output file.
    - And we might want in-place editing.

- Action docs.

- Better --help: show step docs.

- Some tests.

- More steps:
    cols
    wrap
    flip-flop
    filename
    linenumber
    tail
    dive

- Also support leading-dot syntax:

    m .skip 1 .head 12 .findall '\d+' .str .nl

- Switch PATHS to --paths?
