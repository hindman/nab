Support in-place editing where input-path == output-path.
    - Use temp file and then rename.

Some end-to-end tests.
    - Make sure all/most steps are working.

Better --help: show step docs and Step.DESC.

Support leading-dot syntax:
    m .skip 1 .head 12 .findall '\d+' .str .nl

Reassess existing steps and add more:
    cols
    wrap
    flip-flop
    filename
    linenumber
    tail
    dive
    cross

Check my scripts in $HOME/bin for behaviors not yet supported.

step_has_phase(): confirm that this is robust (eg inheritance).
