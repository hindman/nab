--------
File discovery and text encodings
--------

Implement basic discover steps:
    - Open.
    - Walk.
    - Glob.

Unicode handling:

    - Default:
        - Support the `--encoding IN OUT` option (default: utf-8 for both).
        - Read input line: if it is bytes, decode it using --encoding IN.
        - Step.out() and Step.err(): if not bytes, encode it using --encoding OUT.

    - Implement steps.
        - Encode.
        - Decode.

    - Default behavior when calling next(FH):
        - Py2 | stdin/file | binary_type
        - Py3 | stdin/file | text_type

--------
Step work
--------

Add Step.context [see notes].

Testing: setup; write a few basic tests of various types; better way to capture outputs.

Steps: rename existing steps to align with latest plan.

Steps 1 [see notes]

--------
Key enhancements
--------

Support leading-dot syntax and --step-mode option [see notes].

Better help [see notes].

Testing: widen coverage.

Steps 2 - 6 [see notes]

--------
Later
--------

Steps 7 - 8 [see notes]

Support paths via several mechanisms [see notes].

Debuggability and logging.

Testing: full coverage.

Add NabRgx helper class to simply regex usages [see notes].

step_has_phase(): confirm that this is robust (eg inheritance).

Support BFS processing [see notes].

Support parallel file processing [see notes].

Allow user to control input record separator (default = newline).

Support .nabrc file [see notes].

DataDict() helper class for positional data processing [see notes].

Dryrun support [see notes].
