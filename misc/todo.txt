--------
Core functionality
--------

Unicode handling:

    - Line input: decode, if needed:
        - ln.val should always be str (Py3) or unicde (Py2).
        - Behavior varies between opened files and stdin.
        - Might also vary between Py2 and Py3.

    - Output: encode, if needed.

    - Str(): convert to six.text_type, not Py2-str.

    - Provide user an option to control encodings.

Add Step.context [see notes].
